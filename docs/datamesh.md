DataMesh
--------
If you zoom out to a Database's core functions, you have: Storage, Replication and Indexing. Acknowledging this (and inspired by [TokyoCabinet/tkrzw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkrzw)'s view of indexing and storage) I suddenly wanted a DB more concentrated on edge changes, where filters could live for days or weeks with little to no impact as the primary data would sit in-memory (this library was originally built when [Hana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_HANA) was being developed) or in-stream. This manifested with this library, which... while implemented as a DB currently, has much wider uses as a fragmented datastore in a distributed system. So a DataMesh: `selects/subscribes data for downstream peers`, `synchronizes it's datastore with it's incoming stream` and eventually may support `indexing` (someday, when it supports data on disk, since the current in-memory scheme allows sets to be simple indexes by themselves)
